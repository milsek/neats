## NEATS: NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) Agent for Two-dimensional Games

NEATS is an artificial intelligence (AI) project focused on creating intelligent agents capable of learning and mastering two-dimensional games, specifically Flappy Bird and The Chrome Dino Game. The project leverages the power of neural evolution to train agents that can autonomously play and excel at these games.

### Features:

- **Python Core Engine:** The core engine of NEATS is implemented in Python, providing a robust foundation for the neural evolution algorithm and game interaction.

- **JavaScript and p5.js Library:** NEATS incorporates JavaScript, utilizing the p5.js library for the game implementations and frontend. This combination allows for dynamic and interactive game environments, enhancing the learning capabilities of the AI agents.

- **Neural Evolution:** NEATS employs a neural evolution approach to train agents. Over time, these agents evolve and adapt their strategies to achieve optimal performance in the specified games.

### How it Works:

1. **Neural Evolution:** NEATS starts with a population of agents, each with a randomly initialized neural network. Through a process of evolution, the fittest agents are selected to reproduce, passing on their genetic information with slight mutations. This iterative process continues until agents demonstrate proficient gameplay.

2. **Game Interaction:** The agents interact with the games using the Python core engine and JavaScript frontend. NEATS captures game state information and feeds it into the neural networks, allowing the agents to make decisions and learn from their experiences.
